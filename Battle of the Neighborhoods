Multiple factors need to be considered based on the specific needs of the individual(s) to make daily life more convenient. While such decisions can be made relative easily via manula observation for a small city, it becomes much harder for a large metropolitan city.\n\nStudies have shown that in todays modern world the majority of people are migrating from small rural cities and towns to large urban metros in search of better job or education opertunities or a more modern lifestyle. This trend brings about a need for a more analytical approach to identifying the best neighbourhoods to move to based on the needs of the individual(s).\n\n### Problem Description:\n\nA metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. Such rapid growth and expansion attracts a larege number of talented individuals from all accross the globe.\n\nLet us consider a basic question: Why are they moving there?\n\nThe indivudual(s) could be moving to start a business. This could be in the form of a small business. This leads to the addiotion of a unique venue to that particular neighbourhood, providing thate neighbourhood with an amenity that would fulfil the needs of other individuals. Thus for any individual moving to that city the best neighbourhood to mmove to would first and foremost be decided based on the basic amenities/services that the neighbourhood can provide for the needs of the individual.\n\nUnfortunately due to the large number of the same types of amenities scattered around such cities. Finding the right neighbourhood with all the required amenities using manual methods is highly time consuming. For example the basic amenities needed by an individual such as myself would be grocery store, gym, indian resturant, gas station, park, theatre etc. But these amenites are typically available scattered around the city in large numbers. analysing each neighbourhood would be very tedious.\n\nAdditionally there could be amenities that would produce undesireable affects in a neighbourhood. For example bars, clubs, hotels, etc produce a large amount of noise and sometimes neighbourhoods with a large concentration of such amenities could also result in high crime rates. Prefering peace and quite during the night time when I am most likely to be at home, I would not like to move to such neighbourhoods.\n\nThe power of data science will thus be used to make this decision for us.\n\n### Target Audience:\n\nI am the target audience for this analysis since I plan to move to Toronto by the end of 2020.\n\nWhile this project is primarily motivated by my need to identify the right neighbourhood to move to Toronto, the same approch can be used by any individual who wants to move to any major city to reduce the list of neighbourhoods to consider.\n\n\n\n# Week 2 - Data:\n\nThe different data sources and how they are used:\n\n1. Toronto Postal Code Data\n\nFirst the total list of postal Codes in the Ontario region is extracted using the Beautiful Soup package from the Wikipedia page:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M\n\nThis list was then filtered for only the postal codes in Toronto and a list of neighbourhoods is extracted.\n\n2. Latitude and Logitude Data from the Google API\n\nThe Google API is used in conjecture with the Postal codes to pull their corresponding LAtitude and Longitude information.\n\n3. Four Square API data (and basic amenities list)\n\nThe Four Square API is used with the Latitude and Longitude information as input to pull a list of the venues within each Postal Code.\nThis data is used to perform the K-Means clustering  to cluster the neighbourhoods.\n\nThis data is also further used to identify the uniques Venues within each cluster thus categorizing them \n\n4. Crime Rate and Noise Pollution Data\n\nAddtionally Crime rate and Noise Pollution data was used to further make a decision on the ideal Neighbourhood. \n\nCrime Rate:https://www.kaggle.com/alincijov/toronto-crime-rate-per-neighbourhood/data?select=Neighbourhood_Crime_Rates_%28Boundary_File%29_.csv\n\nNoise pollution levels: https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/8f4d-tph-Environmental-Noise-Study-2017.pdf\n\n"
